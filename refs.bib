  abstract  = {New security risks, continuously evolving regulation and increasing security standards have created new and growing needs for secure internal information transfers, which SSH provides. This book addresses these new trends in depth, offering the most up-to-date information on the integration of SSH into a security environment. It covers the newest features and applications of SSH-2 (which received Proposed Standard status from the IETF in 2006). SSH2 is more secure than previous versions and has many expanded uses on a wider variety of computing platforms. Another particular note driving new SSH2 adoption are the requirements of recent legislation (PCI/HIPAA/SOX/FISMA). SSH 2 has become an even more valuable tool, as it provides communications security compliance with the latest standards. This book offers the most up-to-date information on SSH2 in a practical, hands-on, tutorial-style reference that goes well beyond UNIX implementation. It concentrates on the latest version of SSH 2 with all new information and is accompanied by companion Website that contains useful scripts and utilities, providing administrators with the newest ways to incorporate this most useful utility into their network tool box. * Discover why SSH2 offers more robust security than SSH1 and how to incorporate it into your network administration software toolbox. * Case studies illustrate the benefits of SSH2 in diverse applications from e-commerce to data management. * Companion Web site provides custom scripts and other useful utilities, which can be tailored to meet the needs of your specific environment}
